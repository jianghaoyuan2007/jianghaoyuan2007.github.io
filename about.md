I'm Stephen Chiang. I come from Heilongjiang. I live in Beijing now. I'm an iOS engineer. I like running, badminton and reading. I like iOS programming, because iOS is very cool, it's extremely awesome user experience. The Apple provides a lot of documents to support developers. When I finish my work, run my program on iPhone device, I am very excited. Besides Objective-C Programming language, I also like Swift, Ruby and Python. I like using the productivity utilities to improve my software and process of development. I also like sharing my experience. I enjoy programming.
