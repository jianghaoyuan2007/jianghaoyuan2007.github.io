Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

Wikipedia describes them as

>
> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Real world example

> Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets, bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.

Wikipedia says

### Programmatic example

Translating our example from above. First of all we have our strategy interface and different strategy implementations

```java
interface SortStrategy
{
    public function sort(array $dataset): array;
}

class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortStrategy
{
    public function sort(array $dataset): array
    {
        echo "Sorting using bubble sort";

        // Do sorting
        return $dataset;
    }
}

class QuickSortStrategy implements SortStrategy
{
    public function sort(array $dataset): array
    {
        echo "Sorting using quick sort";

        // Do sorting
        return $dataset;
    }
}
```

And then we have our client that is going to use any strategy

```java
class Sorter
{
    protected $sorter;

    public function __construct(SortStrategy $sorter)
    {
        $this->sorter = $sorter;
    }

    public function sort(array $dataset): array
    {
        return $this->sorter->sort($dataset);
    }
}
```

And it can be used as

```java
$dataset = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8];

$sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy());
$sorter->sort($dataset); // Output : Sorting using bubble sort

$sorter = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy());
$sorter->sort($dataset); // Output : Sorting using quick sort
```
